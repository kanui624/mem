Mem is a web application that allows users to sign up, sign in, and create a memory or "mem" by filling out the given parameters like mood, thoughts, and location. After filling out their mem a 'mem-timeline' will populate along with a map UI for every mem added. Mem was built utilizing the MVC paradigm with a Ruby on Rails backend.

This project served as the final project in my coding bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin. During creation I had to meet the following requirements:

- Allow a user to create an account, sign in, and sign out
- Accept user input and store input in a relational database
- Allow user, with the correct access credentials, to view input data on protected url
- Demonstrate all other CRUD operations in some way
- Utilize third party styling
- Utilize a testing library
- Integrate a third party API
- Push to version control and a hosting service

The technologies used to accomplish this were:

- Devise for Authentication
- Bootstrap for third party styling
- Google maps API to serve as the third party API
- Postgresql for the relational database
- Rspec testing library for tests
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Ruby on Rails for all other CRUD operations
- Heroku for hosting

Mem was not designed responsively as that was not a requirement, so it's best fit for a 15" laptop like the one I built it on. With that said, fully understanding the fundamentals of building a backend API, testing it, and getting it to talk to a relational database was what this project was centered around.
